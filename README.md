## Punakea. Tagging for Mac OS X.

Punakea is a Mac App designed to help you cope with the day-to-day struggle of managing your files. Complementing Spotlight, it allows you to tag your files and bookmarks, freeing you of the strict hierarchy of the Finder's folder structure. It's like Finder Tags, but with a tag cloud!
