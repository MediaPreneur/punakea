writes Finder Spotlight Comments with the syntax:
 <pre>###begin_tags###[prefix]tag1;[prefix]tag2;...[prefix]tagN;###end_tags###</pre>
 
 this is the preferred way to store tags in the finder comment,
 in order to separate the tags completely from the rest
 of the comment content - tags are very unlikely to get mixed up
 with user generated content.
